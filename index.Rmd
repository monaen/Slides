## Motivation
The world has witnessed the rapid rising of China in the last decades. China is set to overtake Japan as the world's second-largest economy in a resurgence that is changing everything from the global balance of military and financial power to culture influence.

However, traditional research on chinese culture mostly based on the analysis in theory. Very few work is based on data but rarely known to people. The motivation of this project is aim at populizing the famous and recent work to people who have no professional background at all. Thus, we utilize data visualization techniques to simplify previous research and show the intuitive result to people all around the world.
